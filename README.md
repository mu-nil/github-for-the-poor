# github-for-the-poor

Many developers don't get to work 40 hours a week. They grind 50 to 60 hours a week to write 1000s of lines of codes to stay alive and employed. They don't have time to contribute to Github projects and they can't leave that job because they don't have Github contributions to interviewers who ask for their Github activities. "Github For The Poor" is a project aiming to emancipate the poor coders from that malicious chain.
